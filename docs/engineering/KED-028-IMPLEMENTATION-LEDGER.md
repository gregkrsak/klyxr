Greg authorized GitHub Actions as the authoritative compilation and executable
validation environment. Local Rust validation is unavailable because of confirmed
Work-runtime extraction corruption. No local Rust execution, installation,
extraction, integrity probing or remediation is performed during this assignment.
Source edits, Python text processing and Git operations are local. Shell push
lacks credentials; connected GitHub Git-data operations publish reviewed commits.

## Unchanged baseline gate

Fetched origin/prod and verified exact commit/tree. Index and worktree were clean.
No authorized remote branch existed; created it unchanged at the exact baseline.
All four push workflows passed independently:

| Workflow | Run |
| --- | --- |
| build | https://github.com/gregkrsak/klyxr/actions/runs/38787690440 |
| tests | https://github.com/gregkrsak/klyxr/actions/runs/38787690500 |
| docs | https://github.com/gregkrsak/klyxr/actions/runs/38787690573 |

The complete tests job (116603833362) supplied both debug and release identity
inventories: exactly 1,667 each, identical identities and outcomes, all `ok`.
`ked-028-predecessors.json` preserves this exact inventory, including the authority
compile-fail doctest. Both profiles execute the 1,800-case affine cross-check.
The original KED-027 inventory and verifier are preserved as historical evidence.

## Milestone 1 — prepared checker replacement

Canonical assignment validation checks mutable owned target identity and exact
RHS type. The existing single ownership checker snapshots prepared entry, validates
target availability and relative loop eligibility, prevents target consumption
through its canonical consume path, evaluates the complete RHS, expires ordinary
loans and checks final whole-owner exclusivity. Its scoped restriction creates
no synthetic loan and participates in complete rollback. Copy assignment retains
its existing path. Runtime replacement authority and generations are later layers;
this milestone does not claim complete KED-028 execution.

### Predecessor corrections

The four designated rejection-to-acceptance migrations are listed exactly in
`ked-028-evidence.json`; assertions now establish acceptance and RHS transfer.
The pressure review's `boundary_tests` namespace is corrected to the observed
`bounds_and_artifact_tests` identity without changing its witness.

One additional obsolete rejection was found in the exact inventory:
`tests/iteration_local_moves.rs::iteration_local_replacement`. It initializes a
mutable owner inside the current loop iteration and replaces it with `fresh()`.
Frozen §12 expressly accepts this form. The test keeps its identity and source,
but now asserts acceptance. This is recorded separately as an outcome correction,
not hidden among the four designated renames. No frozen semantic change is made.

Header-target, header-source, break and return witnesses remain Ownership
rejections, with diagnostics updated to the narrower controlling loop boundary.
The CLI non-Copy dereference fixture remains unchanged.

New focused checker tests cover final and future shared/exclusive uses,
self-consumption at nested RHS depth, moved/conditional targets, exact nominal
and reference boundaries, branches, iteration-local exits and nested-loop targets.
New identities require explicit manifest membership; counts alone cannot pass CI.

Milestone validation is pending. No PR, acceptance, issue closure or merge.

### First milestone CI and repair

Commit `bf3b3686ad66fcba5174e54642bf24681765184f`, tree
`feb1857c91492db115ea4f9e80e8cca3fa91469a`:
build https://github.com/gregkrsak/klyxr/actions/runs/38788406841 (formatting failed;
workspace/all-target compilation passed), tests

https://github.com/gregkrsak/klyxr/actions/runs/38788406935 (passed).

Applied the GitHub Rustfmt diffs as text, without local Rust execution.
`later_exclusive_handle_blocks_commit` originally passed the exclusive handle by
value and then used it again; KD-021 correctly rejected the moved handle, rather
than retaining it as a live loan at replacement commit. Its intended live-loan
witness now reads a Copy field non-consumingly on the RHS and uses the handle
later. The original fixture remains as a separate moved-handle rejection test.
No accepted ownership contract was relaxed. No later architectural layer added.

Milestone 1 repair commit: `4da4fb30801c75a7d2549222f87a96d37ca1c389`, tree

Both debug and release: 1,680 passing identities, comprising the exact 1,667
predecessors with explicit corrections and thirteen additions; no failed,
ignored or filtered tests. Both affine checks and authority doctests passed.

## Milestone 2 — explicit MIR replacement authority

Compound ReplaceOwned operations retain canonical local/record identity,
declaring lexical scope, fixed canonical cleanup-plan reference (or inert), full
RHS, replacement origin and span. Structured lowering binds an outer target to
its owning scope, even inside a branch. Exact opaque correspondence prevents
missing, duplicated, reordered, wrong-target/type/scope/plan/origin artifacts from
executing. Existing admission bounds scope and owner metadata. Only the complete
replacement RHS result gains a resource lifetime boundary; argument temporaries
remain rejected. No second ownership engine is introduced.

The executor explicitly refuses ReplaceOwned pending the next validated runtime
layer. This intermediate milestone does not claim executable replacement support.
Generation machinery and runtime evidence follow only after its four CI gates.

The complete debug/release jobs passed exact inventory reconciliation.

## Milestone 3 — generation foundation

Dynamic activation histories now identify each initialization generation, with a
separate frame/local-to-current-generation association. Histories own no payload.
Before cleanup, the live entry must match the slot association; a stale entry
cannot release the current occupant. Global checked generation sequences and
activation identities distinguish repeated dynamic instances of one LocalId.
Association/history capacity growth is reserved together and counted in storage.
Existing initialization and cleanup fuel charges remain unchanged.

New controls inspect repeated loop activations and inject a stale generation
while verifying exact resource-identity conservation. Replacement execution remains
disabled until this foundation passes all four workflows.

Both complete test profiles and exact inventory reconciliation passed.

## Milestone 4 — protected replacement vertical slice

A bounded stack of prepared replacement contexts is allocated before RHS work.
Old ownership stays in its slot while RHS evaluation runs. The complete new value
moves infallibly from its existing holder into separate protected storage before
fallible generation reservation or displacement. Detached old ownership is retained
explicitly, then transferred into the existing canonical cleanup cursors. Successful
cleanup discharges the old generation. Publication, slot association and reserved
history append form one allocation-free transition in the target's owning activation.
Ordinary continuation remains inaccessible on any terminal failure.

Inert public records use the same protocol without executable cleanup. Copy writes
retain their original route. Protected replacement results do not reuse return,
construction or cleanup scratch holders. All context/history capacities and both
payloads count simultaneously toward storage; progress and skipped discharged
history entries charge fuel. Resume and completion reject unfinished replacement.

First runtime evidence covers exact A/B/C acquisition and release identities,
repeated inert execution, distinct-source transfer, repeated leaf replacement,
every fuel cut with identity conservation, exact sufficient fuel and trusted
release Host failure retaining N separately. Aggregate/recursive and full boundary
batteries remain the next gate after validation.
