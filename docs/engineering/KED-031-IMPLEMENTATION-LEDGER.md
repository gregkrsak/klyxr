# KED-031 implementation ledger

## Authority and provenance

Frozen [Issue #72 Draft 4](https://github.com/gregkrsak/klyxr/issues/72), decision
6252193611, Sarah confirmation 6252268406, freeze 6252312068, implementation
6252329672, and pressure review 6251651535 control. Greg's complete fresh local-first
directive supersedes the earlier emergency GitHub-only policy. The production
Arnold charter was read at governance revision
`2887c9239fb6f82ded4fd7b2d8f5f592b725cccc`.

Exact authorized predecessor commit: `63a89f2062a33e5cec452df1ee0b3b2f27781f55`.
Tree: `653afdad686e1d5280427e11ff233463d4dc9dab`.
Branch: `ked-031-typed-recoverable-failure`; PR target: `prod`.
The unchanged predecessor gate is accepted evidence and was not repeated as a
startup requirement. Its exact 1,790 identities are retained in
`ked-031-predecessors.json`, derived from the unchanged KED-030 inventory plus
its 47 classified additions. Historical manifests and reconcilers are preserved.

The resume audit recorded `git status --short`, inspected all existing tracked
and untracked implementation changes, and ran `git diff --check`. They belonged
to KED-031. The existing worktree was continued without reset, clean, deletion,
overwrite or branch recreation. Local changes during implementation are expected.

## Implementation

One early canonical Error tag serves both exact source aliases Error and Err.
The lexer reserves the complete ASCII case-insensitive Result/Ok/Error/Err/match
families. Parser and resolver both enforce identifier reservation. Source type
syntax uses a finite postorder graph; canonical ordered payload pairs use a
separate ResultTypeId DAG. No RecordId or reference referent counterfeits Result.
Complete table validation includes unused rows, exact IDs, categories, uniqueness,
ordering, cycles and depth. Contextual constructors require a complete exact type;
raw named-range literal formation and conditional Result initialization remain
excluded. Pattern coverage normalizes aliases before checking.

The existing ownership checker alone tracks Move/loan permission and unresolved
outcome facts. Facts survive conservative conditional Move state and short-circuit
skips. Every successful scope/arm/function/loop exit validates duties before state
reduction. Transfers record exact destinations. Nested payload bindings initialize
independent duties. One bounded append-only trail records initialization,
construction, match bindings/origins, transfer and validated exit evidence across
branch snapshots. It is retained independently in opaque approval. No MIR or
runtime ownership checker is introduced.

Ordered variant plans retain shared canonical record/nested Result references.
Resource-bearingness and cleanup-effect unions are separate properties. Nested
inert Results retain plan identity without release work. Both arm bodies are
statically checked; only the selected binding/body runs. MIR explicitly represents
tag dispatch, selected payload transfer, lexical arm scopes and source origins.
Exact deterministic HIR/MIR/origin correspondence and independently retained
outcome/plan/effect authority reject artifact substitutions before execution.

Flat machine cells own actual Result payloads, including cleanup-inert values.
Non-cloneable handles, parent links and validated constructor-site correspondence
protect payloads through evaluation, publication, scrutinee retirement, dispatch,
selected-binding reservation, transfer, arm entry, calls and protected returns.
Combined prospective growth precedes detach. A failed callee cleanup retains the
outgoing Error Result and prevents caller delivery. No stop becomes Error and no
resume, unwind, rollback or retry is manufactured. Recurring arm bindings reuse
only inert storage from completed lexical activations; live resource or Result
owners cannot be overwritten.

Whole-wrapper cleanup is limited to the independently sealed primitive/protocol
domain and traverses only the actual active payload. Ordinary source must exhaustively
match or transfer its outcome. The public output representation is a bounded flat
active chain and one Bool/range/inert-record payload. Resource-bearing public
Result entries reject before execution or acquisition. Result-only execution does
not activate the resource catalog. No production resource API is exposed.

## Evidence domains and malformed controls

`ked-031-evidence.json` lists every addition, one conservative evidence-domain
classification per identity, all preserved-ID fixture adaptations, and zero
contract corrections or identity migrations. Mixed failure injection/artifact
mutation tests are classified as primitive/protocol even when they also contain
ordinary controls. A test using private canonical resource registration does not
establish a public source resource API. Inherited private-domain classifications
remain recorded in the KED-030 manifest.

- Ordinary source: 26 identities in `compiler/tests/results.rs`, covering mixed
  failure aliases and arm orders, contextual and exact payload types, namespace
  and capitalization, KD-025/KD-037 exclusions, scope and structured exits, nested
  duties, conditional/short-circuit loss, propagation, effects, public records,
  recurring arm activation and bounded public output.
- Private canonical resources: five identities covering success/inert failure,
  inert success/resource failure, equal resource types, nesting, effects on both
  alternatives, replacement generations, payload construction traps and public
  entry exclusion.
- Primitive/protocol and adversarial artifacts: 15 identities cover actual stopped
  holders, every fuel/storage/allocation cut, cleanup failure and protected returns,
  separate whole-wrapper authority, tables, witnesses, HIR/MIR, origins, plans,
  effects, admission and rendering. Distinct resource alternatives union filesystem
  and clock cleanup contracts independently of the active runtime alternative.

Mutation matrices reject invalid/duplicate/foreign/cyclic/over-depth Result IDs,
wrong nominal payloads, missing/duplicate/reordered/wrong-target arms, foreign or
duplicate bindings, wrong function/type/origins, missing/fabricated/duplicate
transfers, erased/reordered witnesses, foreign/duplicated/swapped plan roles,
shrunk effect unions, forged domain authority, incorrect scope parent/init/exit
metadata, and protected-return metadata changes. Runtime probes independently
reject unknown/Err-derived tags, same-payload-type tag flips, missing/wrong payload,
foreign origins/parents and consumed cells. Single active-payload storage excludes
a two-inline-payload representation structurally; duplicated detach and binding
artifacts reject. Nested outcome omission and conditional laundering reject in
the source ownership phase. Existing replacement-generation and approved-abort
mutants remain mandatory predecessors, rather than becoming new source authority.

## Development corrections and fixture adaptations

Ordinary compiler errors, test failures and formatting diagnostics were diagnosed
locally. Corrections included the all-empty record cleanup-summary sentinel,
public inert-record staging in Result regions, recurring inert binding reuse,
pre-execution exclusion of private resource Result returns, and combined outcome
plus cleanup admission reservations. The existing resource terminal diagnostic was
preserved. None required a semantic deviation or architectural reinterpretation.

Source fixtures using result or ok now use unreserved names; the shared value-flow
example uses returned. Corresponding source-name/span expectations were updated.
Exhaustive predecessor enum visitors explicitly reject unexpected Result forms;
manual AST/private seal scaffolding supplies the new empty metadata. Assertions,
identities, proof counts and all predecessor outcomes remain required. No valid
test was removed, ignored, filtered, weakened or contract-corrected.

## Environment and limits

The existing checksum-verified Rust 1.80.0 installation is unchanged:
`/tmp/rust-clean-vywtlaad/toolchain/bin/` contains rustc/rustdoc 1.80.0
(051478957 2024-07-21), cargo 1.80.0 (376290515 2024-07-16), rustfmt
1.7.0-stable and Clippy 0.1.80 (0514789 2024-07-21). All seven compiler/component
executables were compared with their previously verified size, mode and SHA-256
snapshot before the final pass. No toolchain installation or repair was performed.
One target, `/tmp/klyxr-ked031-target-lrwxlvcf`, serves all development/final checks.
No Cargo target cleaning, artifact copying or target substitution was used.

The accepted `/usr/bin/ps` failure `fatal library error, lookup self` is an ancillary
process-namespace/procfs visibility limitation, not failed Klyxr validation. Greg
and Miles authorized resumption. No ps/procps retry, process-table discovery or
repair is used; command runners manage known child sessions. No Rust integrity,
mode, truncation, loader or crash anomaly was observed during this implementation.
This does not claim that every utility in the host environment is healthy.

Outcome/type/proof storage is bounded before analysis. Result programs additionally
reserve quadratic witness storage and snapshot capacity; nonempty cleanup evidence
combines its storage/work reservation with that Result envelope. Every runtime
cell, continuation, temporary and payload capacity is prospectively charged. Flat
nested type/custody/output metadata avoids recursively owned Result chains.
Consumed runtime cells remain charged metadata: a sufficiently long loop may hit
the configured storage limit. Host abort, process termination and external memory
corruption remain outside structured reporting. These are tool limits, not proof
of termination or ordinary program correctness.

## Validation and publication disposition

Final local commands, profile counts, ancillary results and exact remote workflow
identities are recorded below after execution. Focused development runs are not
substitutes for the complete final profiles. Source inspection/editing and local
execution are distinct from GitHub-executed evidence. No authored test is counted
as passing until it executes.

Implementation completion is separate from independent review, Greg's acceptance,
issue closure and merge. No merge or direct prod write is authorized or performed.

## Completed final local validation

`cargo doc` used `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`. Rust executable paths resolve
under `/tmp/rust-clean-vywtlaad/toolchain/bin`; RUSTC and RUSTDOC explicitly select
those exact files. Toolchain integrity matched all seven verified executable
snapshots. No debug/release executable failed to load or crashed.

Each complete profile: **1,790 predecessors + 46 additions = 1,836 passing
identities**, zero failed/ignored/filtered; zero identity migrations. The compile-fail
authority doctest passed in each profile. The preserved affine identity executed
its 1,800-case cross-check in each profile.

Result failure example: `Error(ErrorCode(1))`; success example: `Reading(42)`.
Unhandled outcome rejects with its Ownership diagnostic. Battery positive control
proves one function and checks one call; negative control preserves all four
precondition/value diagnostic fragments. The complete CLI integration target also
ran in both profiles. README assets and scaffold checks passed; generated context
was byte-identical after regeneration. Final pre-commit diff integrity passed;
the index was unchanged and all worktree changes were scoped implementation work.

The final gate runner initially used an incorrect success-output substring for
the positive battery control; that command itself exited 0. The assertion was
corrected to the actual proven-function/call fields, and the complete gate above
passed after the final scope-mutation tests were included. This was evidence-harness
work, not a compiler, source-semantic or platform failure.

Git HTTPS remote inspection failed before publication because its configured local
proxy endpoint refused connection. No proxy repair or repeat toolchain gate was
attempted. The connected GitHub API independently confirmed prod at the exact
baseline and the implementation branch absent. Publication uses Git data objects,
checks every uploaded blob SHA and the complete tree against the locally staged
validated content, and then creates the dedicated branch. This transport limitation
is distinct from local Rust validation and from the accepted ps incident.
