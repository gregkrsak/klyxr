# Klyxr Compiler and Verification Architecture

## 1. High-level pipeline

   ├──────── verification path ────────▶ VIR ─────▶ SMT / prover
   │
   └──────── code generation path ─────▶ backend ─▶ machine code
```

The backend must not define Klyxr's source-level semantics.

## 2. AST

The AST preserves source structure for diagnostics, formatting, documentation, and syntax-aware tooling.

## 3. HIR

Typed HIR resolves source conveniences into clearer semantics.

Responsibilities may include:

- resolved names;
- canonical types;
- desugaring;
- normalized keyword aliases;
- generic/trait metadata;
- effect declarations;
- contracts.

Example:

```text
mut
mutable
   ↓
KW_MUTABLE
```

Original spelling remains available for source-aware tooling.

## 4. Ownership and regions

Relevant values/bindings conceptually transition among:

- Owned
- Borrowed immutable
- Borrowed mutable
- Moved

Regions/lifetimes should primarily be inferred.

## 5. Effect analysis

Conceptual judgment:

```text
Γ ⊢ expression : Type ! Effects
```

Effects propagate transitively.

A caller denying `heap` must not reach allocation through a hidden call chain.

## 6. MIR

MIR is control-flow oriented and suitable for:

- ownership analysis;
- drop elaboration;
- borrow checking;
- effect propagation;
- contract instrumentation;
- verification lowering;
- backend lowering.

## 7. VIR

VIR is the restricted verification representation.

Expected concepts include:

- `assume`
- `assert`
- `forall`
- `exists`
- `old`
- `invariant`
- `variant`
- `havoc`

An initial verifier may target Z3 or another SMT solver. Solver choice is not language semantics.

## 8. Contract semantics

Conceptually:

- caller establishes `requires`;
- callee establishes `ensures`;
- invariants hold at defined semantic boundaries.

Checked mode may lower contracts to runtime checks.  
Verified mode generates proof obligations.

## 9. Loop verification

Verified loops may require invariants and termination variants where termination must be proven.

## 10. Trust tracking

`trusted` statements/declarations should retain:

- source location;
- rationale;
- direct dependents;
- transitive dependents where feasible.

A future command may support:

```bash
klyxr audit --trust
```

## 11. Unsafe boundaries

Unsafe operations should be lexically visible.

Possible future direction:

```klyxr
unsafe
    assumes ptr != null
    assumes ptr aligned_for T
{
    ...
}
```

Exact syntax remains open.

## 12. Realtime / embedded profiles

Initial support should focus on structural restrictions such as:

- no heap;
- no unbounded blocking;
- constrained recursion;
- bounded loops where policy requires it.

Do not claim arbitrary WCET analysis until it truly exists.

## 13. Runtime strategy

Klyxr should support modular runtime configurations from hosted targets to bare metal.

## 14. Implementation direction

Current direction:

- first compiler likely implemented in Rust;
- LLVM is a plausible initial code-generation backend;
- Z3 is a plausible initial SMT backend;
- self-hosting is a long-term possibility.

These are implementation choices, not permanent language semantics.

```

## 16. MVP boundary

A narrow first compiler should target:

- integers and `Bool`;
- bindings and mutation;
- functions;
- records;
- `if` / `while`;
- range types;
- basic `Option` / `Result`;
- basic matching;
- moves and borrows;
- `requires` / `ensures`;
- deterministic checked arithmetic;
- machine-code backend;
- simple integer verification.

The MVP should demonstrate the difference between memory safety and application-level verified correctness before pursuing breadth.

## 17. Current executable prototype

The first compiler slice is implemented in Rust, with its toolchain pinned to
1.80.0. It follows source → lexer/parser → AST → semantic validation → specialized
integer contract proof → diagnostics. HIR, MIR, VIR, general ownership/effect
analysis, SMT integration, and code generation are not yet implemented. This
temporary path is a bounded prototype of the architecture, not a replacement for
KD-012's direction.

The AST retains supported postconditions and subtraction statements; no function
body or contract is silently skipped. Ordered construction/call statements form a
prototype harness. The checker rejects unresolved references, distinct-record
type mismatches, invalid ranges, duplicate names, and mutable access to immutable
bindings. It proves every declared body independently of its call sites, then uses
the established postcondition to update caller state in source order.

For the supported precondition `amount <= state.field` and postcondition
`state.field == old(state.field) - amount`, the proof establishes signed i64
subtraction safety, range preservation at each assignment, and the final equality
over every admissible input. It uses affine extrema at the vertices of the
range rectangle clipped by the precondition. This is a specialized proof with
the implementation in its trusted base, not an SMT proof or proof certificate.
Empty admissible domains are explicitly rejected by this prototype.

The exact grammar, mathematical argument, CLI behavior, and limitations live in
`compiler/README.md`. The broader language's representation, assurance-boundary,
invariant, and snapshot rules remain open. Relevant entries: KD-005, KD-006,
KD-013, KD-014, KD-015, KD-017, DP-008, DP-009, and OQ-018 through OQ-020.
