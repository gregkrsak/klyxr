   ├──────── verification path ────────▶ VIR ─────▶ SMT / prover
   │
   └──────── code generation path ─────▶ backend ─▶ machine code
```

The backend must not define Klyxr's source-level semantics.

## 2. AST

The AST preserves source structure for diagnostics, formatting, documentation, and syntax-aware tooling.

## 3. HIR

Typed HIR resolves source conveniences into clearer semantics.

Responsibilities may include:

- resolved names;
- canonical types;
- desugaring;
- normalized keyword aliases;
- generic/trait metadata;
- effect declarations;
- contracts.

Example:

```text
mut
mutable
   ↓
KW_MUTABLE
```

Original spelling remains available for source-aware tooling.

## 4. Ownership and regions

Relevant values/bindings conceptually transition among:

- Owned
- Borrowed immutable
- Borrowed mutable
- Moved

Regions/lifetimes should primarily be inferred.

## 5. Effect analysis

Conceptual judgment:

```text
Γ ⊢ expression : Type ! Effects
```

Effects propagate transitively.

A caller denying `heap` must not reach allocation through a hidden call chain.

## 6. MIR

MIR is control-flow oriented and suitable for:

- ownership analysis;
- drop elaboration;
- borrow checking;
- effect propagation;
- contract instrumentation;
- verification lowering;
- backend lowering.

## 7. VIR

VIR is the restricted verification representation.

Expected concepts include:

- `assume`
- `assert`
- `forall`
- `exists`
- `old`
- `invariant`
- `variant`
- `havoc`

An initial verifier may target Z3 or another SMT solver. Solver choice is not language semantics.

## 8. Contract semantics

Conceptually:

- caller establishes `requires`;
- callee establishes `ensures`;
- invariants hold at defined semantic boundaries.

Checked mode may lower contracts to runtime checks.  
Verified mode generates proof obligations.

## 9. Loop verification

Verified loops may require invariants and termination variants where termination must be proven.

## 10. Trust tracking

`trusted` statements/declarations should retain:

- source location;
- rationale;
- direct dependents;
- transitive dependents where feasible.

A future command may support:

```bash
klyxr audit --trust
```

## 11. Unsafe boundaries

Unsafe operations should be lexically visible.

Possible future direction:

```klyxr
unsafe
    assumes ptr != null
    assumes ptr aligned_for T
{
    ...
}
```

Exact syntax remains open.

## 12. Realtime / embedded profiles

Initial support should focus on structural restrictions such as:

- no heap;
- no unbounded blocking;
- constrained recursion;
- bounded loops where policy requires it.

Do not claim arbitrary WCET analysis until it truly exists.

## 13. Runtime strategy

Klyxr should support modular runtime configurations from hosted targets to bare metal.

## 14. Implementation direction

Current direction:

- first compiler likely implemented in Rust;
- LLVM is a plausible initial code-generation backend;
- Z3 is a plausible initial SMT backend;
- self-hosting is a long-term possibility.

These are implementation choices, not permanent language semantics.

## 15. Proposed repository structure

```

## 16. MVP boundary

A narrow first compiler should target:

- integers and `Bool`;
- bindings and mutation;
- functions;
- records;
- `if` / `while`;
- range types;
- basic `Option` / `Result`;
- basic matching;
- moves and borrows;
- `requires` / `ensures`;
- deterministic checked arithmetic;
- machine-code backend;
- simple integer verification.

The MVP should demonstrate the difference between memory safety and application-level verified correctness before pursuing breadth.

## 17. Current executable prototype

The compiler prototype is implemented in Rust, pinned to 1.80.0. The executable
pipeline is source → lexer → parser → AST → explicit name resolution → expression
and value-flow type checking → typed HIR → core ownership checking → specialized
integer contract proof → diagnostics. This implements KD-012, KD-018, KD-019,
and KD-020 only for the documented
subset; the broader pipeline above remains accepted architecture/future work.

The AST preserves textual declarations, parameter types, explicit ordinary
returns, local initializers, expression calls, contracts, and ordered prototype
statements. `FunctionDecl` retains source order across ordinary and verified forms.
The resolver collects all declarations/signatures before resolving bodies, owns
name lookup and source-order local scope, and assigns strongly typed range, record,
field, function, parameter, local, and harness-binding IDs. Locals enter scope after
resolving their initializer; no shadowing or cross-function local scope is supported.
Forward and recursive ordinary calls resolve without execution or termination
analysis. Source type names resolve to canonical references; `compiler/types`
validates declared value types, operators, initializers, calls, and returns without
textual name lookup.

One canonical `FunctionId` table contains both ordinary value and verified mutation
functions, in source declaration order. Both kinds share the existing function
namespace. Ordinary signatures/materialized locals use `ValueType::Bool`,
`ValueType::Range(RangeTypeId)`, or `ValueType::Record(RecordId)`; `IntegerLiteral`
remains expression-only. Expressions represent records by the same canonical
RecordId. Record arguments and returns require exact nominal identity; existing
operators do not accept record values. HIR
local and call references carry `LocalId` and `FunctionId`, with typed arguments,
initializers, and explicit returns. Nominal compatibility uses exact range/record IDs.
Names and spans are diagnostic metadata. `hir::Program` owns compilation-local
canonical tables, including locals, and exposes read-only slices/ID lookups.
Storage is crate-private; internal construction/transformations must preserve
identity and reference invariants. IDs have no cross-compilation stability.

Ordinary functions have explicit value return types and exactly one final
`return expression;`. Immutable locals propagate concrete initializer types;
call arguments and returns require exact concrete types. Bare integer locals,
arguments to range parameters, and returns do not gain implicit range types.
KED-004 and KED-005 do not execute, prove, or dynamically enforce ordinary functions.
`Range(T)` typing does not prove bounds or overflow safety. Plain `fn` is not a
claim to implement the full future `safe` model. All mixed-kind calls are rejected.

`compiler/ownership` is a dedicated phase that inspects canonical typed HIR without
rebuilding it or adding public ownership annotations. Its private classification
is Bool/range → Copy, record → Move, regardless of field types. It tracks only
ordinary by-value ParameterId/LocalId places, using separate strongly typed place
variants in a per-function state table. Record parameters begin Available. Local
initializers are analyzed before introducing a fresh local owner. Value references
consume Move places through bindings, by-value calls, and returns; Copy places
remain reusable. Call results are fresh values, without public temporary IDs.

State is Available or Moved with the prior source span and transfer destination.
Use-after-move produces the first precise `FrontendError::Ownership` diagnostic,
with the later use span and prior move location. Names are diagnostic metadata;
classification and state use canonical types and IDs. Children are traversed in
source order for deterministic diagnostics, without settling runtime evaluation
order. There are no branches, joins, fixed points, or inlined callee states.
Forward/recursive calls are checked structurally, not executed or proven terminating.
Unused owners are accepted without destruction behavior.

The ownership phase excludes the verified state parameter, fields, and BindingId
harness state. It adds no borrowing, mutable locals, ordinary field access/record
construction, partial moves, user-defined Copy/Clone, or destructors. Source names
and nominal type errors must be resolved before ownership checking.

The verifier takes only a verified-function view from the shared HIR table;
ordinary functions are ignored as proof targets and never counted as proven.
Verified AST/HIR contracts remain expressions, and subtraction statements have
expression operands. The verifier recognizes only the original resolved battery
proof structure and parameter/literal body operands. Richer well-typed expressions
inside verified functions receive spanned verifier-support diagnostics. The
private affine kernel and its independent 1,800-case cross-check retain their
existing mathematical coverage, including independently varying numeric domains.

Ordered record construction/call statements remain the prototype harness. The
checker retains distinct-record checks, range checks, and immutable-binding
rejection. Every verified body is proven independently of its call sites; its
postcondition then updates caller state in source order. Ordinary functions do
not enter that state model.

MIR, VIR, ownership beyond this straight-line move subset, borrowing/effect
analysis, destruction, SMT integration, runtime lowering,
and code generation remain unimplemented. This subset does not settle broader
HIR, modules, generalized inference/coercions, arithmetic enforcement, or mixed
assurance semantics.

For the supported precondition `amount <= state.field` and postcondition
`state.field == old(state.field) - amount`, the proof establishes signed i64
subtraction safety, range preservation at each assignment, and the final equality
over every admissible input. It uses affine extrema at the vertices of the
range rectangle clipped by the precondition. This is a specialized proof with
the implementation in its trusted base, not an SMT proof or proof certificate.
Empty admissible domains are explicitly rejected by this prototype.

The exact grammar, mathematical argument, CLI behavior, and limitations live in
`compiler/README.md`. The broader language's representation, assurance-boundary,
invariant, and snapshot rules remain open. Relevant entries: KD-005, KD-006, KD-012,
KD-013, KD-014, KD-015, KD-017, KD-018, KD-019, KD-020, DP-008, DP-009, and OQ-018 through OQ-023.
