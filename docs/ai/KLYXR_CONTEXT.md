# Klyxr Context

> **Read this first. You are joining an existing language-design project. Do not reinterpret settled decisions unless explicitly asked.**

## Project identity

**Klyxr** is a systems programming language in development.

Pronunciation: **“CLICK-ser.”**

Primary public site: `klyxr.com`  
Secondary owned domain: `klyxr.online`  
Primary source extension: `.klx`  
CLI executable: `klyxr`

Primary public line:

> **Systems programming you can reason about.**

Core philosophy:

> **Own what moves. Constrain what exists. Prove what matters. Make every escape hatch visible.**

Canonical public summary:

> **Klyxr is a systems programming language that treats memory safety as the foundation, then lets programmers express and verify more of the rules that make their software correct.**

## Why Klyxr exists

Klyxr begins from the premise that **memory safety is the beginning of the argument, not the end**.

Systems software also depends on rules such as:

- this value must remain within a valid range;
- this function may not allocate;
- this task must not block;
- this state transition is legal only under defined conditions;
- this API must preserve an invariant;
- this routine must not panic;
- this external assumption is trusted rather than proven.

Those facts often live in comments, tests, conventions, wrapper types, code review, runtime assertions, external tools, or institutional knowledge.

Klyxr's core proposition is:

> **More of those facts should be part of the program itself.**

Once they are part of the program, the compiler and verifier should be able to reason about them.

## Current implementation status

An executable compiler prototype, written in Rust, supports ordinary straight-line
value functions alongside a narrow one-field record/signed-integer contract subset.
Explicit resolution assigns compilation-local function, parameter, local, type,
field, and top-level binding IDs. Expression and value-flow type checking produce
canonical typed HIR. Public HIR inspection remains read-only; names/spans are
diagnostic metadata.

KED-004 introduced ordinary Bool/range value functions, immutable locals, calls,
and explicit `return expression;` (KD-019). KED-005 now permits existing records
by value in ordinary signatures, call results, locals, and returns. Ordinary and
verified functions retain one function namespace and ID table. Bare integer
literals do not materialize as locals, arguments, or returns.

The dedicated ownership phase runs after type checking. Bool and named ranges
are `Copy`; records are non-`Copy` and move through bindings, by-value arguments,
and returns (KD-020). ParameterId/LocalId state is per function; a moved place
cannot be reused. The compiler does not silently clone. Record fields do not make
records Copy. KED-006 adds explicit shared (`&T`) and exclusive (`&mut T`)
whole-value borrowing. Shared references are Copy; mutable references move.
`let mut` / `let mutable` marks an owned local as exclusively borrowable, without
reassignment. Immutable reference locals carry private loan provenance. Loans
end after the last future use of all derived available handles; call arguments
remain held until the receiving call completes, including nested arguments.
Availability and loans are separate ID-based state within the same ownership phase.
Borrowing/cloning/reborrowing/coercion are never implicit. Ordinary owned parameters
remain immutable. Reference returns, nested references, explicit lifetimes,
dereference, reference mutation, ordinary record construction/field access,
partial borrowing/moves, and destruction remain unsupported (KD-021 / OQ-024).

Ordinary functions are parsed, resolved, type-checked, and ownership-checked,
including loan legality, but not executed or proven. A range result type does not establish that the
produced value meets its bounds. Plain `fn` does not yet implement the complete
future `safe` assurance model. Forward and recursive calls remain structurally
valid without a termination claim. Diagnostic traversal order does not settle
runtime evaluation order.

The verifier continues to recognize the original battery-contract structure by
IDs and rejects richer well-typed expressions inside that verified path with a
verifier-support diagnostic. It ignores ordinary functions as proof targets.
Its affine proof establishes subtraction safety, field ranges, and postconditions
for every admissible input of the supported structure, and tracks state between
literal-argument harness calls. Calls across function kinds are rejected; OQ-019,
OQ-021 through OQ-024 retain the broader assurance, arithmetic, function,
Copy/destruction, and advanced borrowing questions.
General ownership beyond core moves and straight-line whole-value loans, effects, runtime
contracts, MIR/VIR, SMT integration,
and machine-code generation remain unimplemented. Read `compiler/README.md`
before making claims about what the executable establishes.

## Intellectual lineage

Klyxr deliberately combines lessons from **Rust** and **Ada/SPARK**, while aiming to become its own coherent language.

### Rust contribution

Rust demonstrated that ownership and borrowing can make strong memory-safety guarantees practical in a high-performance systems language.

Klyxr takes ownership as a foundational model.

### Ada/SPARK contribution

Ada/SPARK demonstrated that constrained types, contracts, static analysis, invariants, and formal proof can be practical tools for real systems engineering.

Klyxr carries that assurance culture into an ownership-based language and contemporary developer workflow.

### Klyxr's center of gravity

A useful public shorthand is:

> **Rust makes memory safety a core language guarantee. Klyxr takes that as the starting point and extends the same compile-time philosophy to contracts, system effects, domain constraints, trust boundaries, and formal verification.**

And:

> **SPARK brings formal methods to Ada. Klyxr is designed to make provable systems programming feel native to the ownership generation.**

These are explanatory simplifications, not claims that Rust or SPARK are incapable of adjacent features.

## Assurance model

Klyxr has three escalating assurance levels:

### `safe`

Ordinary language guarantees such as ownership, initialization, reference validity, bounded access, race restrictions, and deterministic destruction.

### `checked`

Additional contracts, ranges, invariants, or related rules are enforced dynamically where appropriate.

### `verified`

Declared proof obligations must be established statically by the verifier.

The same language is used across all three levels.

Key principle:

> **Verification is not a second language you graduate into. It is an assurance level you apply where it earns its cost.**

## Core language direction

Klyxr currently includes or intends to include:

- ownership and move semantics;
- immutable and mutable borrowing;
- deterministic destruction;
- no required garbage collector;
- distinct range/domain types;
- units and dimension-aware types;
- records with invariants;
- `requires` / `ensures` contracts;
- `old(...)` in postconditions;
- quantification for verification;
- Rust-like algebraic enums and exhaustive `match`;
- `Option<T>` rather than universal null;
- `Result<T, E>` and `?`-style error propagation;
- traits/generics with an explicit static-vs-dynamic dispatch distinction;
- explicit effects such as heap allocation, blocking, I/O, time, randomness, filesystem, networking, and unsafe behavior;
- auditable `safe`, `trusted`, and `unsafe` boundaries;
- embedded and realtime profiles;
- explicit data representation for hardware/protocol work;
- a Cargo-like unified toolchain.

## Public trust model

Klyxr must be precise about what a guarantee means.

A verified function does **not** mean:

> “This program is correct.”

It means:

> **The stated properties were proven under the stated assumptions.**

Klyxr should make it easy to distinguish:

- what the compiler knows;
- what the verifier proved;
- what the programmer trusted;
- where `unsafe` exists;
- and what remains unknown.

Do not market Klyxr as eliminating bugs, proving arbitrary global correctness, or making testing unnecessary.

## Flagship examples

### Application-level correctness

```klyxr
type Percent = range 0..100;

record Battery {
    charge: Percent
}

verified fn consume(
    battery: &mut Battery,
    amount: Percent
)
    requires amount <= battery.charge
    ensures battery.charge == old(battery.charge) - amount
{
    battery.charge -= amount;
}
```

A call that attempts to consume `90` from a battery at `80` charge is memory-safe but contract-invalid.

That distinction is central to Klyxr.

### Effects

```klyxr
#[deny_effects(heap, blocking)]
fn control_loop(...)
    effects clock
{
    estimate_state(...);
}
```

A transitive allocation should be diagnosable through the call graph.

The rule should be compiler-visible rather than merely documented.

## AI collaboration rules

When assisting with Klyxr:

1. Preserve accepted language decisions unless explicitly asked to revisit them.
2. Distinguish **accepted**, **current direction**, **proposed**, and **open**.
3. Do not silently turn a tentative idea into a language guarantee.
4. Do not overclaim verification.
5. Prefer coherent semantics over novelty.
6. Prefer diagnostics and tooling that explain *why* a rule exists.
7. When comparing Klyxr with Rust or Ada/SPARK, be respectful and technically defensible.
8. Treat the repository, not any one conversation, as canonical project memory.
