# Klyxr AI Handoff Package

This directory is the **canonical AI-facing project context** for Klyxr.

Its purpose is to let a fresh model, workspace, or human contributor become productive without relying on hidden conversational history.

## Read order

1. `KLYXR_CONTEXT.md`
2. `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`
3. `LANGUAGE_DECISIONS.md`
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`

For a single-file handoff, use `KLYXR_AI_CONTEXT_BUNDLE.md`.

## Working rule

**Do not reinterpret accepted decisions unless explicitly asked to reopen them.**

When proposing a change:

1. identify the decision or principle it affects;
2. explain why the existing choice is insufficient;
3. present alternatives and tradeoffs;
4. mark the proposal as *proposed* until accepted;
5. update `LANGUAGE_DECISIONS.md` only after acceptance.

The repository, not conversational memory, is the canonical project context.
