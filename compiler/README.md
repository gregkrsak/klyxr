# First Klyxr compiler vertical slice

This Rust implementation is an executable **prototype**, not a general-purpose
Klyxr compiler. It implements a restricted source → lexer → parser → AST →
semantic validation → integer contract proof → diagnostic path.

## Run it

Install Rust through rustup. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins Rust 1.80.0 and rustfmt,
matching the workspace's minimum supported Rust version.

From the repository root:

```bash
cargo run --locked --bin klyxr -- verify examples/battery_ok.klx
cargo run --locked --bin klyxr -- check examples/battery_ok.klx
cargo test --locked --workspace
```

`check` and `verify` currently run the same restricted semantic and proof passes.
These commands are not implementations of the `safe` and `checked` assurance
levels. Success reports the proof scope and counts. Declaration-only inputs
explicitly report that there are no function contracts to verify.

Exit codes: `0` for supported obligations established, `1` for source/semantic/
proof failure, `2` for command usage or file-reading errors.

## Supported grammar

- Distinct named ranges: `type Percent = range 0..100;`. Both endpoints are
  inclusive. The prototype uses signed i64 values, including negative literals
  and the full i64 bounds. This does not settle future range representation.
- One-field records whose field type is a declared range.
- Verified functions with exactly one mutable record reference and one named
  range-valued amount parameter.
- Exactly one precondition: `requires amount <= state.field`.
- Exactly one postcondition:
  `ensures state.field == old(state.field) - amount`.
- Straight-line bodies containing zero or more `state.field -= amount;` or
  `state.field -= signed_integer_literal;` statements. Every field reference
  must resolve to the function's record parameter and its declared field.
- Record construction with a literal field value, followed by calls whose second
  argument is a literal. These top-level statements are a prototype execution
  harness, not a settled language entry-point design. Their source order matters.
- `fn`/`function` and `mut`/`mutable` normalize identically. The other KD-014
  aliases are not yet exercised by this grammar.
- ASCII identifiers, whitespace, and `//` comments.

Unsupported or malformed syntax is rejected. Bodies, postconditions, and unknown
names are never silently skipped. Type and function declarations are resolved
across the input; record bindings must be constructed before their use. Duplicate
names in a declaration namespace or the binding scope are rejected; shadowing
is outside this prototype. Passing an immutable binding to `&mut` is an error.

## What the proof establishes

For **each declared function**, including uncalled functions, the checker proves
that for every input within the two declared ranges satisfying its precondition:

1. Every body subtraction fits signed i64.
2. Every assigned field value remains within its declared range.
3. The final field value equals its entry value minus the amount.

`old(state.field)` means the field's value at function entry. The currently
supported function can change only that one field. A failed obligation includes
an admissible counterexample and source location.

This is a specialized affine proof, not an SMT integration. The admissible input
domain is a rectangle clipped by `amount <= state`. The checker evaluates each
affine intermediate value and the final equality at every vertex of that polygon.
Affine extrema occur at vertices, so these checks establish the obligations over
the entire domain, rather than just observed calls. Vertex coordinates are
integral. Arithmetic during proof uses i128 to detect i64 overflow without host
overflow. The implementation and its mathematical argument are part of the
prototype's trusted base; there are no independently checked proof certificates.

An empty admissible domain is explicitly rejected by this prototype. It does not
report a vacuous proof as a useful verification result. An empty body is allowed
only if it actually establishes the postcondition (for example, an amount type
whose only value is zero).

At each call, the checker validates the record's distinct type, mutable binding,
amount range, and precondition using the **current** field value. It updates state
from the proven callee postcondition. A failed executable statement stops later
call analysis, avoiding conclusions based on stale state.

```klyxr
let mut battery = Battery { charge: 80 };
consume(&mut battery, 50); // leaves 30
consume(&mut battery, 50); // rejected: 50 <= 30 is false
```

## Limits and next work

The prototype does not implement general ownership/borrowing, moves, lifetimes,
effects, runtime contracts, general expressions, loops, quantifiers, multiple
fields, record invariants, SMT/VIR/MIR, or machine-code generation. In particular,
`examples/effects.klx` is illustrative and is rejected rather than analyzed.
A successful prototype result must not be described as establishing those
unimplemented properties or unspecified program correctness.

This work implements portions of KD-005, KD-006, KD-013, KD-014, and KD-015,
subject to KD-017 and DP-008/DP-009. It does not reopen accepted language decisions
or freeze the broader language's syntax (OQ-018). Mixed assurance boundaries,
general mutation framing, and snapshot semantics beyond this one-field subset
remain design work.

## Regression coverage

The tests cover invalid declarations/references, unsupported syntax, postcondition
failures, signed arithmetic limits, range preservation, independent records,
source-order execution, sequential calls, keyword aliases, CLI output and exit
codes. An independent exhaustive interpreter compares the affine proof results
with every admissible integer input across 1,800 small range/body combinations.
CI runs the tests in debug and optimized builds.

The failing examples are intentional:

- `battery_fail.klx`: invalid first-call precondition.
- `battery_sequence_fail.klx`: invalid second-call precondition after mutation.
- `battery_body_fail.klx`: uncalled body fails its postcondition.
